Design:
CellularAutomata
	Summary
		Grid with cells (contained within 2D array)
		Cells have finite states
		Cells have neighborhoods
	Variables
		Color States - alive/dead etc.
		Grid
		generation
		animation?
		rules?
	Methods
		checkRules(cell)
		nextGen()
	Subclasses
		GameOfLife - only one to not need probability
		Fire
		MoveCellularAutomata
			Checks rule and then updates instantly. 
			Segregation
			Wator
			
MoveCellularAutomata?
	Summary
		applying rules moves some figure
		checking rules and then updating in same step
	Variables
		Collection movers
	Methods
		nextGen - loops over movers and resets movers when finished
		getRandomMove
	Subclasses
		Segregation
		Water
		
Movers
	Summary
	Variables
		moved
		Cell myCell
	Methods
		getType
		move
		isMoved
		reset

Fish extends Movers
	Variables
		spawnTime
	Methods
		canBreed
		breed
		survive
		
Shark extends Fish - not needed?
	Variables
		energySpent
	Methods
		spendEnergy
		checkOutofEnegy

Cell (abstract)
	Summary
		Have neighborhoods
		Have a certain shape
		Have a state
		Have a position
	Variables
		Shape - covers both shape and current state
		nextState - next generation color
	Methods
		drawShape
		setNextState
		isState
		update
	Subclasses
		SquareCell
		HexagonCell
		TriangleCell
		
Grid
	Summary
	Variables
		Size of cells
		size of grid
		2d cell array
	Methods
		calculateCellSize
		makeGrid
		createIterator
		getNeighbors
			checkBounds
			gridPoint
	Subclasses
		TorusGrid
			makes the grid a torus shape.
			changes gridPoint

XMLReader - 
	Chooses file with JChooser
	uses constructor to set file chosen
	parses xml into doc and then parses doc
	establishes variables from xml files so can be used by CellSocietyView
			
Animation?
	Summary
		Animations grid and has buttons
	Variables
	Methods
		makeTimeline
		makeButtons
		makeUIButton
		
Rules?
	Summary
		Each rule has a condition based upon initial state and states of neighbors
	Variables
		initalState
		neighborCondition
	Method
		checkInitialState
		checkNeighborStates
		applyChange
	Comments
		sometimes we need the arraylist that we create in checkneighborstates
		
Parameters: (initially read/stored in xml files)
	Type of grid (torus or not)
	Shape of cell (square, triangle, hexagon)
	Grid size (possibly infinite)
	Rules/States/Games
	Initial configuration
	

Cell:
Not sure if this is completely needed but most likely it's better to have.
Need to check if all getters/method are needed.

Wator and Segregation.
Trouble when dealing with cells to move.
Problems: need to keep track which cells hold things that have moved
Also need to change the nextGen method so that it doesn't all happen at once.
Possible solutions: 
Creating an Movers (abstract?) that extends Cell? Then we can ignore the cells,
and simply cover over the empty ones.
Let's us loop through the movers
Let's us deal with all classes that move better
Complicates through how to move an object (mostly bad in triangle class)
-actually may not be that difficult, update based on position of cell
-sketch of implementation

Movers:
Variables
boolean moved;
ArrayList<Paint> validMoves
Methods
isMoved
move(Cell from, Cell to)

For now will not deal with this problem.
Alternatives/questions:
should this be in the cell class or perhaps the grid class

CellularAutomata/Grid:
which class should hold the nextGen method
-should consider reabstracting and considering more objects

Grid
Should create an iterator class?
How do we change the shape of the grid based on a parameter

/resources:
Contains backend names for all UIButtons in game 
Contains xml files which read in default info
	xml:
	Node - "Simulation"
	Tag - "Parameters" - get this tag's info with method to go through all tags
	(there's only 1)
	colors - cell states
	initial parameters: cell num, grid type, grid size, etc.
	All simulations need probability parameter except for GameOfLife (prob)
*Need to link XMLReader to CellSocietyView
